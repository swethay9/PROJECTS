## Overview

This project provides insights into how New Yorkers utilize taxi services. It analyzes pickup and drop-off locations, trip durations, and temporal variations to draw meaningful conclusions. Key outputs include spatial density plots, clustering results, and a zoomed-in view of Manhattan's taxi activity.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is based on the **2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data**.  
**Key files:**
- `train.csv`: Training set (1,458,644 records)
- `test.csv`: Testing set (625,134 records)
- `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission format  

**Fields in the dataset:**
- **id**: Unique identifier for trips  
- **vendor_id**: Code for the provider  
- **pickup/dropoff_datetime**: Start and end timestamps  
- **pickup/dropoff_latitude & longitude**: Geospatial coordinates  
- **passenger_count**: Number of passengers  
- **trip_duration**: Duration in seconds

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nyc-taxi-trip-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Removal of outliers and transformation to meaningful units.  
- **Spatial Density Analysis**: Visualize pickup and drop-off activity on a heatmap.  
- **Temporal Trends**: Analyze usage patterns by hour, day, and month.  
- **Clustering**: Group trips into templates to summarize NYC's taxi activity.

## Visualization Highlights

1. **Trip Duration Distribution**: Histogram of trip durations.  
2. **Spatial Density Maps**: Log-scaled density plots for pickups and drop-offs.  
3. **Manhattan Focus**: Zoomed-in view of Manhattan's taxi activity.  
4. **Cluster Analysis**: Template trips visualized on NYC's map with source-destination connections.

## Clustering Analysis

- **Attributes Used**:  
  - Source latitude and longitude  
  - Destination latitude and longitude  
  - Trip duration  
- **Clustering Algorithm**: MiniBatch KMeans with 80 clusters.
- **Outcome**: Identifies stereotypical trip patterns in NYC.

## Usage

### Run the Analysis and Visualization

1. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python nyc_taxi_analysis.py
   ```
3. Results will include visualizations such as spatial density maps and cluster templates.

### GUI Showcase for Result Images
